## Introduction
Welcome to the Spyro the Dragon PC port project called OpenSpyro! OpenSpyro is an open-source initiative driven by a passionate programmer and fan of the original Spyro the Dragon trilogy on Playstation. The project is focused on reverse-engineering and adapting the game to run natively on PC systems. I aim to provide an authentic experience that stays true to the original while leveraging the capabilities of modern hardware.
This project will not contain any game data, you must have an original ROM of the game available in order to play this port.
## Goals
* No emulation required to run the game on PC
* Staying true to the original game in terms of functionality
* Use OpenGL natively for rendering graphics
## Commands
Here's a list CLI commands currently supported:
* `generate-doc`
* `mips-assemble`
* `mips-disassemble`
* `ps1exe-assemble`
* `ps1exe-disassemble`
* `rom-check`
* `rom-extract`
* `rom-replace`
* `wad-read`
